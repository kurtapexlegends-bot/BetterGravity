 * Rewriting Antigravity's own bundle before it executes.
 *
 * This is the one capability that needs the main process: by the time a plugin
 * runs in the page, the application's script has already been parsed. So
 * patches are declared statically in plugin.json, read as the page's scripts load,
 * and applied to the response on its way to the renderer.
 *
 * The bundle is compiled by Closure Compiler, so identifiers are mangled and the
 * only durable anchors are string literals the compiler had to preserve. That
 * makes patches powerful and brittle in equal measure, which is why every one of
 * them reports whether it actually applied.
