/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One observer for every watcher
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `observe` used to hand each caller its own document-wide MutationObserver
 * whose callback re-queried the whole document. Two costs came out of that, and
 * both grow with the number of watchers a plugin installs:
 *
 *   1. Chromium builds a MutationRecord per registered observer, so a plugin
 *      with twenty watchers paid twenty records — each holding NodeLists — for
 *      every node the app touched. Antigravity streams a reply node by node,
 *      and that record churn alone was enough to run the renderer out of
 *      memory on a long conversation.
 *   2. Every batch ran twenty whole-tree `querySelectorAll` calls. Attribute
 *      selectors are not indexed, so each is a walk over every element in the
 *      document.
 *
 * The registry below keeps one observer for the whole runtime and, per batch,
 * scans only what changed. Three things keep that cheap however many watchers
 * there are:
 *
 *   - The attributes watched are the ones the selectors name. An app mid
 *     animation rewrites `style` every frame, and a virtualised list rewrites
 *     the transform of every row it scrolls past; nothing about `style` can
 *     bring an element into a selector that never mentions it, so none of that
 *     traffic is delivered at all.
 *   - A changed root inside another changed root is dropped, so a subtree that
 *     arrives with its attributes already set is scanned once rather than once
 *     per element in it.
 *   - Each root is tested and queried against all the selectors joined
 *     together rather than once per watcher, so a batch that matches nothing —
 *     which is nearly every batch — costs one `matches` and one
 *     `querySelectorAll` for the whole runtime.
 *
 * Watchers are still handed each element exactly once, and still inside the
 * task the app changed the document in, so nothing is painted between the
 * change and the plugin's mark on it.
