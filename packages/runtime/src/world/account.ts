 * `plugin.account`, the signed-in user's name and nothing else.

 * The page cannot read files, and the name is not in Antigravity's own state — it

 * process reads it and this relays the answer.
 *
 * One read per page, shared by every plugin: a plugin that greets the user asks
 * on every visit to the home screen, and Google's record does not change between
 * them. A read that fails is not remembered, so a profile that is being rewritten
 * as the page loads is asked again rather than held wrong for the session.
