// Pets — the Codex desktop pet, rebuilt for Antigravity.
//
// Codex's pet is not a decoration inside its window. It stands on the desktop,
// in a transparent always-on-top window of its own, and it reports: a coloured
// indicator at its top-right, and a stack of cards naming every thread that is
// running, waiting, blocked, or has something unread. That is the whole feature,
// and all four parts of it are here.
//
// HOW IT IS PUT TOGETHER. The file has two halves.
//
//   petSurface() is the pet. It is one self-contained function that draws into
//   whatever document it finds itself in and talks to the outside world through
//   exactly one message channel. It is called twice from the same text: once
//   here in Antigravity's window, and once — after being turned into a string by
//   plugin.overlay and re-evaluated on the other side — inside the transparent
//   desktop window. That is why it closes over nothing at all. The two pets are
//   not two implementations that agree; they are one implementation run twice.
//
//   The sensor is everything after it. Codex reads its own notification tray;
//   Antigravity has no tray, so the same activity entries are built by reading
//   its sidebar. A read of the live conversation store also keeps work visible
//   when rows are filtered or virtualised. Notification priority, timing, and
//   geometry follow the Codex reference; working loops while any agent is active.
//
// Copy this folder into %APPDATA%\BetterGravity\plugins\ and turn on developer
// mode to run it.

/* ═══ PART TWO — the sensor ════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/*
 * Codex drives the pet from its own notification tray, and the tray is filled by
 * the app's own model of what each thread is doing. Antigravity has no tray, so
 * the entries are read off its sidebar instead — but not by guessing at it.
 *
 * Antigravity draws one status mark per row from a single component, and that
 * component is a ladder with the same five outcomes Codex has. From its own
 * bundle:
 *
 *   isArchived              → an archive icon
 *   isPendingUserInteraction→ the tool's icon wrapped in a ping, which is the
 *                             thing that puts [data-testid="attention-dot"] in
 *   isBackgroundWorking     → three bouncing dots in <span aria-label="Loading">
 *   isLoading               → [data-testid="status-loading-spinner"]
 *   isUnread                → [data-testid="status-unread-dot"]
 *   otherwise               → the timestamp, and nothing else
 *
 * which is Vr() in avatar-overlay-native-frame line by line: waiting, then
 * failed, then running, then review, then idle. Antigravity has no
 * conversation-level failure — CascadeRunStatus is only UNSPECIFIED, IDLE,
 * RUNNING, CANCELING, BUSY — so `failed` is the one level with no mark on the
 * row, and it is read off the thread on screen instead.
 *
 * The reading is the only part of the pet that is not Codex's. Everything done
 * with the result is — the priority order, the tone, the labels, the expiries,
 * how many fit in the stack, and the sort.

 * two ways. Either it is doing something now — working, needs input, blocked,
 * the levels that cannot be stale — or the pet watched its level change, which
 * is the nearest thing a DOM read has to "this happened while I was here". A dot
 * that was already lit when the pet arrived is the baseline and says nothing.
